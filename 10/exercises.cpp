/* TODO: try to write down the exercises we outlined in class today.  In
 * particular, the problem about expressing an integer as the sum of two
 * entries in a vector, and the problem about making a vector unique (and
 * doing so "in-place", and without taking a quadratic number of steps). */
/* TODO: if you haven't done it already, try to write "binary search" for
 * a sorted vector. */
/* TODO: start on project 3!  Remember to do the warm-up first. */
